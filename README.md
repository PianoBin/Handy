What does it do?
---
Using the SDK and API of Leap Motion V2, we have compiled a program to help ordinary people become extraordinary speakers. With a leap motion sensor, our application can sense different aspects of your body-speaking style such as hand placement, hand speed, hand angle, and finger pointing to give you feedback on how to improve your body language so next time you can knock the socks off your audience. Welcome to Handy.

Logistics
---
One of the most important things you can do when you are speaking in front of a crowd - on a stage, in a lecture hall, or anywhere else - is engage that crowd. How do you do that? With proper body language. Now this raises the question: what is proper body language?

Proper Body Language
---
Using tips and tricks from top public speakers all over the world and data from TED Talks, online articles, and other resources, we have come up with a way to measure the effectiveness of your hand movements with the Leap Motion sensor.

Hand Speed
---
Hand speed should deliberate and cautious. Moving your hands too fast or too slow can sometimes distract the audience.

Hand Placement
---
Your hands should lie mostly in the "sweet spot" from your torso to your shoulders. Placing them near your face and above your shoulders often distracts the audience from what you are saying.

Hand Orientation
---
The way you present your hands to the audience - palms up or palms down - can have a major effect on how they view your speech. Open palms signify a speaker ready to share wisdom and information worth listening to, while closed palms have a negative effect on the audience.

Finger Pointing
---
It is a well established paradigm of public speaking that pointing during a speech is usually not best practice. Handy will help control that.

What do we want?
---
We hope that this tool allows people to conquer their fears, develop an effective body language for public speaking, and crush their next speech. Good luck and have fun! Handy is here to help.
